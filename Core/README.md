# Basic Core Java Projects Repository

## üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the **Basic Core Java Projects** repository! This collection of Java applications is designed to strengthen fundamental Java skills while incorporating advanced concepts such as **Concurrency, Multi-threading, Performance Optimization, JVM Internals, Garbage Collection Tuning, and Functional Programming**. 
Each project serves as a practical exercise to deepen understanding and improve real-world problem-solving abilities in Java.

## üî• Key Learning Areas
This repository focuses on:

### ‚úÖ Concurrency, Multi-threading, and Performance Optimization
- Efficient multi-threaded processing for handling tasks concurrently.
- Thread pools, Executors, and Fork/Join framework for task management.
- Optimized synchronization and avoiding common pitfalls like deadlocks.

### ‚úÖ JVM Internals and Garbage Collection Tuning
- Understanding JVM memory model: Heap, Stack, Metaspace.
- Garbage Collection (GC) strategies and performance tuning.
- Profiling and debugging memory leaks in Java applications.

### ‚úÖ Functional Programming with Java Streams & Lambda Expressions
- Stream API for data processing and transformation.
- Higher-order functions, method references, and lambda expressions.
- Parallel Streams for improved performance in multi-core systems.
