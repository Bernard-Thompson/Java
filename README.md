   - Implements serverless functions using **AWS Lambda, DynamoDB**, and **S3** for reports.
   - Offers a chatbot integration for real-time cost queries.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Enterprise Knowledge Graph System**
   - Builds a **Neo4j-based** knowledge graph for internal company documentation and relations.
   - Uses **Spring Data Neo4j** and a **GraphQL API** for intuitive queries.
   - Integrates with **OpenAI API** for natural language question answering.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Automated Code Review System**
   - A bot that reviews Java code commits in GitHub using **SonarQube, JUnit**, and **CodeQL**.
   - Provides AI-driven suggestions for best practices and optimizations.
   - Uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD integration.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Decentralized Identity Management System**
   - Implements **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** principles using **Ethereum Smart Contracts**.
   - Uses **Spring Boot, JWT, IPFS**, and **React** for user management.
   - Provides **OAuth2**-based authentication for secure login.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Event-Driven Microservices System for E-Commerce**
   - Implements event-driven architecture using **Kafka and Spring Cloud Stream**.
   - Microservices include **Inventory, Payment, Order Processing**, and **User Management**.
   - Uses **PostgreSQL and Redis** for data storage.

## üéØ Learning Path (Mid-Level to Senior-Level Development)
To bridge the gap from mid-level to senior-level development, I have outlined a learning roadmap with key skills and concepts:

‚úÖ **Advanced Java Concepts**

   - JVM Performance Tuning  
   - Reflection, Annotations, and Instrumentation  

‚úÖ **Software Architecture & Design Patterns**  
   - DDD (Domain-Driven Design)  
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)  
   - Event Sourcing  
   - Microservices & API Gateway Patterns  

‚úÖ **Cloud & DevOps**  
   - AWS (EKS, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, IAM, SNS, SQS)  
   - Kubernetes & Docker  
   - CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)  

‚úÖ **Security & Resilience**  
   - OAuth2 & OpenID Connect  
   - Secure API Design & JWT Authentication  
   - Distributed Tracing & Observability (Zipkin, Prometheus, Grafana)  

‚úÖ **Big Data & Real-Time Processing**  
   - Apache Kafka, Spark, and Flink  
   - NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)  
   - ElasticSearch & Log Analytics  

‚úÖ **Machine Learning & AI Integration**
