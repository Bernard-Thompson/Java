# Java Application Repository

## üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to my Java Application Repository! 
This repository serves as a collection of unique and standout Java-based application ideas, along with a structured projected roadmap from mid-level to senior-level development. 
My goal is to build practical, scalable, and innovative applications while continuously refining my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, AWS, and more.

## üí° Unique & Standout Java Application Ideas
Here are some new Java projects that I'm working on or aim to develop / improve upon:

### 1. **Decentralized Identity Verification System**
   - A blockchain-based identity verification system using Java, Spring Boot, and Hyperledger Fabric to create secure, immutable user identities.

### 2. **AI-Powered Code Review Assistant**
   - A Spring Boot-powered web service that integrates with GitHub to perform automated code reviews, provide suggestions, and analyze code quality using AI/ML.

### 3. **Dynamic Pricing Engine for E-commerce**
   - A real-time pricing engine that adjusts product prices based on demand, competitor analysis, and inventory levels using Java, Apache Kafka, and AWS Lambda.

### 4. **Java-Based Financial Portfolio Optimizer**
   - A full-stack Java and React application that uses Monte Carlo simulations and AI to help users optimize their investment portfolios.

### 5. **Real-time Fraud Detection System**
   - A fraud detection service using Java, Spring Boot, and Apache Flink to analyze financial transactions and detect anomalies in real-time.

### 6. **Event-Driven Microservices Notification System**
   - A Java microservices-based system that integrates with Kafka, WebSockets, and AWS SNS/SQS to provide real-time notifications for user actions.

### 7. **Distributed Load Testing Framework**
   - A scalable Java-based tool to perform distributed load testing for APIs and web applications, leveraging JMeter, Kubernetes, and AWS.

### 8. **Intelligent Resume Screening System**
   - A Java NLP-based resume screening tool that analyzes resumes, ranks them based on job descriptions, and integrates with applicant tracking systems.
